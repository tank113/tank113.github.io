I was extremely fond of Computers since the time my father bought it for his personal use. The first thing i wanted to do was play games on Computer. But then later I discovered that we can do lot of other things as well on Computers Soon my interest grew towards programing Started with BASICS, LOGO and eventually C and C++

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and learned lot of interesting subjects Then I joined Samsung Research India as a Software Developer, but soon I realized that the work is too monotonous and wanted to explore more in the field of Big Data and Data Science as it was booming field. Finally, I decided to Quit my job and pursue Masters.

I enrolled in Msc. Software Systems Engineering in RWTH Aachen University and studied some amazing and interesting subjects like
